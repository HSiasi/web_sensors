# Tell OpenOCD which SPI flash voltage is used by the board (3.3 or 1.8)
# The TDI pin of ESP32 is also a bootstrap pin that selects the voltage the SPI flash
# chip runs at. When a hard reset happens (e.g. because someone switches the board off
# and on) the ESP32 will use the current TDI value as the bootstrap value because the
# JTAG adapter overrides the pull-up or pull-down resistor that is supposed to do the
# bootstrapping. These lines basically set the idle value of the TDI line to a
# specified value, therefore reducing the chance of a bad bootup due to a bad flash
# voltage greatly.
# This option defaults to 3.3, if not set. To override the default, uncomment
# the following line:
# set ESP32_FLASH_VOLTAGE 1.8
